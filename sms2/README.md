## 🎯 Overview

The School Management System is a robust console application that allows educational institutions to efficiently manage their personnel records. The system supports three types of users: Students, Teachers, and Staff members, each with their specific attributes and functionalities.

### Key Features

- **Multi-User Management**: Handle Students, Teachers, and Staff with dedicated workflows
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Built using C++ classes with inheritance and polymorphism
- **Data Persistence**: File-based storage system for permanent data retention
- **Interactive Console Interface**: User-friendly menu-driven navigation
- **Data Validation**: Input validation and error handling
- **Search & Modify**: Find and update records by unique ID
- **System Statistics**: Real-time database status and record distribution
- **Memory Management**: Efficient dynamic memory allocation and cleanup

### Technical Highlights

- **Inheritance Hierarchy**: Abstract `Person` base class with `Student`, `Teacher`, and `Staff` derived classes
- **Polymorphism**: Virtual functions for type-specific behavior
- **Static Counting**: Track object instances across all classes
- **File I/O**: Separate data files for each entity type
- **Utility System**: Formatted console output with professional styling

## 📋 System Requirements

### Runtime Requirements (Pre-built Executable)
- **OS**: Windows 7/10/11 (64-bit)
- **RAM**: 128 MB minimum
- **Storage**: 10 MB free space
- **Display**: Console/Terminal support

### Development Requirements (Source Compilation)
- **Compiler**: GCC 7.0+ / MSVC 2017+ / Clang 6.0+
- **C++ Standard**: C++11 or higher
- **OS**: Windows, Linux, or macOS
- **RAM**: 512 MB minimum (for compilation)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Run Pre-built Executable (Recommended)

If you don't have a C++ compiler installed, you can run the program directly:

```bash
# Navigate to build directory
cd build

# Run the application
.\sms.exe
```

### Option 2: Compile from Source

```bash
# Create build directory (if not exists)
mkdir build

# Compile the application
g++ -std=c++11 -Iinclude src/*.cpp -o build/sms.exe

# Run the application
cd build
.\sms.exe
```

### Option 3: Compile and Run Tests

```bash
# Compile unit tests
g++ -std=c++11 -Iinclude tests/UnitTest.cpp src/Person.cpp src/Student.cpp src/Teacher.cpp src/Staff.cpp src/Utility.cpp src/Database_handler.cpp -o build/UnitTest.exe

# Compile integration tests
g++ -std=c++11 -Iinclude tests/IntegrationTest.cpp src/Person.cpp src/Student.cpp src/Teacher.cpp src/Staff.cpp src/Utility.cpp src/Database_handler.cpp -o build/IntegrationTest.exe

# Run tests
cd build
.\UnitTest.exe
.\IntegrationTest.exe

# Or Run through a Testing Suite I created
cd build
RunTests.bat
```

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Main Menu Options

The system provides five main functions accessible through a menu-driven interface:

```
SCHOOL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## 🗂️ Data Storage

The system uses file-based storage with separate files for each entity type. The data directory is located in the project root, while executables are in the `build/` folder:

```
project-root/
├── data/                    # Data storage (project root)
│   ├── students.txt         # Student records
│   ├── teachers.txt         # Teacher records
│   └── staff.txt            # Staff records
└── build/                   # Compiled executables
    ├── sms.exe              # Main application
    ├── UnitTest.exe         # Unit tests
    └── IntegrationTest.exe  # Integration tests
```

### Data Persistence Features
- **Automatic Loading**: Data loaded on program start from `../data/` (relative to executable)
- **Automatic Saving**: Data saved on program exit to `../data/` directory
- **Directory Auto-Creation**: Data directory created automatically if missing
- **Data Integrity**: File validation and error handling
- **Capacity Management**: Maximum 100 total records
- **Cross-Platform Paths**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

### Important Notes
- **Run from build/ directory**: `cd build && ./sms.exe` (recommended)
- **Run from project root**: `./build/sms.exe` (also works)
- **Data files**: Always stored in project-root/data/ regardless of execution location

## 🧪 Testing

The system includes comprehensive test suites for quality assurance. For detailed testing information, see [tests/README.md](tests/README.md).

### Available Test Executables
- **UnitTest.exe**: Component and class testing
- **IntegrationTest.exe**: System workflow and integration testing

### Quick Test Commands
```bash
cd build
.\UnitTest.exe      # Run unit tests
.\IntegrationTest.exe   # Run integration tests
```

## 🔧 Development

### Code Architecture
- **Abstract Base Class**: `Person` with pure virtual functions
- **Derived Classes**: `Student`, `Teacher`, `Staff` with specific implementations
- **Polymorphism**: Virtual function overriding for type-specific behavior
- **Static Counting**: Class-level instance tracking
- **Memory Management**: RAII principles and proper cleanup

### Compilation Commands
```bash
# Debug build with all warnings
g++ -g -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -Iinclude src/*.cpp -o build/sms.exe

# Release build with optimizations  
g++ -O3 -DNDEBUG -std=c++11 -Iinclude src/*.cpp -o build/sms.exe

# Clean build
rm -rf build/*
mkdir build
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Program Not Starting**
- Ensure `data/` directory exists
- Check file permissions for data files
- Verify executable permissions on `sms.exe`

**Data Not Saving**
- Check write permissions in `data/` directory  
- Ensure sufficient disk space
- Verify data files are not corrupted

**Compilation Errors**
- Ensure C++11 compiler support
- Check include path is correct (`-Iinclude`)
- Verify all source files are present

**Runtime Errors**
- Check system capacity (max 100 records)
- Validate input data format
- Ensure proper program termination
